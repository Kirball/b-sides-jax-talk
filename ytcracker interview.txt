2. i thought it would be funny to represent the seedy digital underground in song form and other people started gravitating to it


3. all of my songs are rooted in truth but sometimes i am just retelling a story for documentarian purposes - an internet bard


4. it has been fun watching defcon continue growing and the hacker community at large - it’s always amazing to rap lyrics you wrote in your basement to a giant crowd and as far back as you can see people are mouthing the words


5. i start with the beat - either i produce it or someone hands me something awesome or i steal one.  I’ve used ableton for everything since about 2011.  i think next year i am going to return to the long format concept album.

6. in 2013, i was hanging with knife party and some other homies in denver raging hard as fuck at their show - i went straight from the after party to the airport for defcon with no luggage, no room, and no plan. i just bought a colorado shirt and did the damn thing that weekend.
