Apologies for the brevity in replies, I've got a lot of stuff to knock out for work but didn't want to return NULL on response.

1. WTF is nerdcore or hackcore? 

It's metadata -- just a label to describe music about nerdy stuff. You could just as easily call it any other name imo. The content is what's important.

2. What brought you into making this genre of music?

I grew up listening to hip hop, and was hacking before I was rapping. Walk the walk, talk the talk, as they say.

3. If you life as epic as your songs? 

I'm a normal individual. I hack computers and make rap music about it.

4. Any great stories from performances at DC besides meeting me you would like to share :P. (Thanks for the photo I will be putting it in the slide) 

Ask metacortex about making a Dual Core show happen at the DC-801 party lol.

5. Tell us about your process of making the music we all love. 

c64 sends me beats, I pick ones that I like, write and record vocals. Vocals get uploaded as full quality wavs which c64 imports into his original sequence on the other side of the Atlantic. He mixes the song, we review the mix (almost always it's fine), and the song is done. Pretty straightforward luckily.

6. Share any interesting stories that would be entertaining to the conference attendees or any life stories you would like shared. Thanks for any help. I will include any contact details or websites you like but will def include twitter handles unless you ask me not to.

Drink all the booze! Hack all the things!

Good luck with your talk :)
