Thank you for taking time to answer these questions if you have any badge life related stories or epic moments to share please take the time to include them.  If you would be willing to video record your answers to these questions that would be greatly appreciated but try to keep them from running over the 3-minute mark should you decide you are comfortable recording it there is no need to read the questions on camera just use them as a guideline to tell your story
