Thank you for taking time to answer these questions if you have any badge life related stories or epic moments to share 
please take the time to include them.  If you would be willing to video record your answers to these questions that would 
be greatly appreciated but try to keep them from running over the 3-minute mark should you decide you are comfortable 
recording it there is no need to read the questions on camera just use them as a guideline to tell your story

Thanks for any help you can provide and any epicness you feel you could contribute to Remo and my talk is so appreciated 
keep doing what you do and I hope to break into the PCB scene soon or if you ever need help I love to solder.   :)
