Here are my responses: 
1. Not sure, the community created these for Defcoin. I've only ever figured out how to solo-mine. 

2. A lot of work is required and I have not ever done it. Russ and Slugbait are the creators of Defcoin who have turned it over to me to manage. 

3. I've been involved with other cryptocurrencies and the idea of a cryptocurrency playground for hackers was exciting. Once I found out about Defcoin I began trying to get people involved. I started a reddit, began mining it and started giving it away leading up to DEF CON. 

4. There have been 2 major camps with Defcoin, one who thinks Defcoin should never have real world value and the other who thinks it should. I have explored each side of the argument and I land somewhere in the middle where I'd like to see Defcoin be accepted by the conference to purchase badges and by vendors to get swag. 

5. This year has been extremely difficult getting things ready for the con in that there are a number of vulnerabilities in the current version of the software. Additionally, we lost the http://defcoin.org  domain and changing the seed nodes is impossible without recompiling the software. It has been difficult to get a Windows version of the software to compile due to the number of legacy libraries that are needed to build it. Despite these, we were still able to get people to mine and people to use Defcoin at DEF CON. 

6. There will likely be a re-branding for DEF CON 26 as well as a hard fork to update to a recent release of Litecoin. There might also be changes to the codebase specifically for hackers. All of this discussion will happen on /r/defcoin. 7. The best way to learn something is to get involved. Feel free to join us on /r/defcoin to see what the future of Defcoin will hold.
